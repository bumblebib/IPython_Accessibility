# Outreachy - IPython Accessibility

As part of the contribution phase, I wanted to restructure the ["Microsoft Corporation Sponsors IPython"](https://ipython.org/microsoft-donation-2013.html) page.
I've edited the overall HTML structure, only for this page, so it can be both accessible and responsive.
And this is the result after checking "Dev Tools" accessibility checker for this page.
